# PyBer Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The CEO of the Ridesharing app PyBer has tasked us with using ride data to create an analytical summary split up by city size. Additionally, a line graph was created to show the weekly fare for each city type for January through April in 2019.

## Results

Below are the results of each key statistic comparing the data between each city type.

### Ride Percentages
Total rides in 2019 : 2375

As expected, cities with larger populations naturally have more demand for ridesharing services. The bulk of the rides, drivers and total fares were from Urban cities, followed by Suburban and lastly Rural. Due to this, however, the average fare per driver in areas with lower populations is increased solely due to the decreased number of drivers. We can even see that the number of rides in Urban areas exceeds the total number of rides. This means that in Urban areas there is a surplus of drivers leading to a number of those wanting to participate left unable to find ride requests.


## Summary of Results

Below are 3 recommendations to increase revenue based on disparities gathered from the analysis of each city type.

- Although it can be difficult to market ridesharing in a rural area due to lower population density, the average fare per driver can be used as a metric to increase the total number of drivers. It is very likely that, due to this driver shortage, riders have had to wait for extended periods of time before receiving a ride leading them to finding a different option the next time they needed a ride somewhere.

- Urban city types, the only segment with a surplus of drivers, would benefit from increased marketing to consumers looking for ridesharing services.

- Incentives could be given to Urban drivers looking for work to drive out to Rural markets in close proximity to spread out the driver density
