# PyBer Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The CEO of the Ridesharing app PyBer has tasked us with using ride data to create an analytical summary split up by city size. Additionally, a line graph was created to show the weekly fare for each city type for January through April in 2019.

## Results

Below are the results of each key statistic comparing the data between each city type.

### Ride Percentages
Total rides in 2019 : 2375

As expected, cities with larger populations naturally have more demand for ridesharing services. The bulk of the rides, drivers and total fares were from Urban cities, followed by Suburban and lastly Rural. Due to this, however, the average fare per driver in areas with lower populations is increased solely due to the decreased number of drivers. We can even see that the number of rides in Urban areas exceeds the total number of rides. This means that in Urban areas there is a surplus of drivers leading to a number of those wanting to participate left unable to find ride requests.
